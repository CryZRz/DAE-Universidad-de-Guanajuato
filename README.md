## DAE-Universidad-de-Guanajuato

**suggestions**.
This web project is a clone of the web page where I studied, I did it mainly to practice sql, 
which is why there is no orm or classes and by not using classes the creation of the json to send to 
the frontend was complicated, it needs a refactor The code in the backend and at the frontend level still needs to 
be made responsive. The project grew too large to refactor it and I don't have the time to do it. I leave it up to you to do it :)
